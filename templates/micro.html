<h1>{{borough_name}}</h1>

<h4>{{borough_name}}'s Lead average is: {{borough_averages[borough_name]['lead']}}(Âµg/l)</h4>
<h4>{{borough_name}}'s Copper average is: {{borough_averages[borough_name]['copper']}}(mg/l)</h4>
<p>The two graphs below represent a given borough's 5 zip codes with the highest Lead and Copper count respectively. <br>
   The percentage that those zip codes Lead or Copper values differ from the NYC average is what is being graphed. <br>
<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
   As is expressed by the graphs, the data varies a lot both between boroughs and between zip codes within boroughs. <br>
   In some boroughs there are data outliers in which one or two zip codes have significantly higher values than the rest of the zip codes in that borough. <br>
  All of this goes to show how localized water quality can be.</p>
