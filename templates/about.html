    <h1>Water Quality in NYC</h1>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>For my Advanced Computer Science Class I was tasked to look at data relating to either social justice, NYC, the environment, or education. <br>
        I found the water quality in New York City to be particularly interesting. The data that I include in this project examines the Lead and Copper levels in tap water. <br>
        The data has been collected over a period of one year, 2023, in all five boroughs and for different zip codes within those boroughs.
      </p>
      <h2>Working Process</h2>
      <h4>1) Picking a Topic</h4>
      <p>When first picking a data set to investigate I was quite overwhelmed by the colossal amount of options available to me. <br>
        I eventually started combing through NYC related data sets, where a few caught my eye.<br> 
        A <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Compliance-at-the-tap-Lead-and-Copper-Data/3wxk-qa8q/about_data">data set</a> that had water quality data from across all five boroughs particularly piqued my interest, and I settled on this one. <br>
          </p>
      <h4>2) Designing a Basic Website</h4>
      <p>After picking my topic of water quality in NYC, designed a simple website outlining a summary of the project along with a summary of my data set. <br>
        After building the website I began sketching different ways I could go about representing the data.<br> 
        I eventually submitted these sketches to my classmates for feedback. <br>
          </p>
      <h4>3) Data Cleansing Process</h4>
      <p>After receiving peer feedback I had to narrow the data down from almost 4,000 data points to 341.<br>
        This was to allow for viewers to digest and understand overall trends in the data with more ease. <br>
        I decided to narrow my scope to just the year 2023 since it is the most recent set of data. <br>
        1) In order to achieve this I first imported my raw data from this source to a spreadsheet application. <br>
        2) I then removed any data with dates that are not from the year 2023. I also removed some less relevant data points such as the kit number and the date the sample was received by the office (Data still included the date the sample was taken). <br>
        3) I then exported this revised 2023 data as a CSV file. <br>
        4) I then wrote a <a href="https://github.com/DrewF27/NYC-Water-Quality/blob/main/data/format_micro_data.py">python script</a> that used the commas in the CSV file to format the data into objects that were accessible in python.
          </p>
      <h4>4) Coding the Project</h4>
      <p>With my peer's feedback on my sketches in mind, I began to work on two different representations of my data. <br>
        The first is a map that is shaded in with values representative of each boroughs combined Lead and Copper averages.<br> 
        The second is two bar charts that represent the zip codes with the five largest Copper or Lead readings per borough and the percentage difference between these data points and the NYC average.<br>
          </p>
    
      <h2>Important Vocabulary</h2>
      <div class="container2">
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Lead: A heavy metal that when ingested can have adverse health effects on the body.</li>
          <li>Copper: A red metal that when ingested can have adverse health effects on the body.</li>
          <li>Tap Water: Drinking water often used for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Prototypes</h2>
      <h3>NYC View</h3>
      <div class="img">
      <img src="images/macro.JPG" alt="Hand drawn prototype of a page with a shaded map of the boroughs based on their water quality."
      width="500" 
     height="600">
    </div>
      <p>Initial Design Reasoning: I figured that a good way to represent water quality across NYC was to use a shaded map to express borough averages of water quality. <br>
      I found this to be an easily understandable chart as well one that told an easily understandable story with my data. <br>
      I would also include a written description of the data next to the map.</p>
      <p>Feedback: My peers suggested that I include a title on my Macro page that makes it clear that the map is a representation of the borough averages in NYC. <br>
        I will now add a title page and more information above the map so that viewers are more informed.
      </p>
      <h3>Borough View</h3>
      <img src="images/micro.JPG" alt="Hand drawn prototype of page with a bar chart displaying a specific borough's zip codes water quality."
      width="700" 
     height="500">
      
      <p>Initial Design Reasoning: I thought that a good way to look at the water quality by zip code would be a bar chart. <br>
         I figured that the chart would be fairly simple and tell a compelling story. <br>
        I would also display a borough average at the top of the graph as well as quantitative analysis on the side.</p>
      <p>Feedback: My peers suggested that I change how I am representing my data. <br>
        They think it would be best to shift from my current idea of a bar chart to a more zoomed in map of NYC that displays each individual zip code. <br>
        I have decided to only graph 5 zip codes per borough. These 5 zip codes will either have the highest Lead or Copper levels depending on which graph they are in. <br>
        These graphs will measure the percentage difference between the data points and the NYC average. </p>
